# File Sharing 

- There are 2 security systems for sharing files
    - NTFS permissions (the security tab)
    - SHARING permissions (the sharing tab)

- Because there are 2 security systems
    - SHARING permissions only affects when people navigate to the file over the SHARE
    - NTFS permissions always applies

- Permissions can be inherited, but this can be disabled

- If there are two conflicting entries - the stricter entry wins

- Permissions allows ALLOW or DENY - don't use DENY unless you have to - it overcomplicates everything - If you are not on the list you are implicitly denied
